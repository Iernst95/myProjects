This game, called &quot;The Warriors Way&quot; is my final project. In the game, you create a character and upgrade him as you fight tougher and tougher enemies. You can upgrade your characters stats such as health, stamina, speed, and strength. You can also save your character and load it later and continue to play! The game has lots of room to be improved upon.  I would like to work on it during the summer and try to make it better and more fun. In the mean time; test it out, play it a bit, and let me know what you think about it! " wrappingWidth="797.22900390625">
